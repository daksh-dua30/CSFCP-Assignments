🧩 Assignment Overview

This assignment helped me understand the importance of structured goal planning, technical knowledge, and professional readiness across five major components:

🔹 Step 1 — Computational Thinking

Designed an algorithm and flowchart for a Resume Keyword Analyzer to automate resume relevance checking.

🔹 Step 2 — Linux & Automation

Executed essential Linux file-management and permission commands and created a bash script to generate a career folder structure automatically.

🔹 Step 3 — Emerging Technology Domain

Researched Artificial Intelligence (AI) including technology overview, job roles, salary trends, certifications, and an Indian startup (Haptik) using AI.

🔹 Step 4 — Career Planning & Professional Readiness

Prepared SMART goals, researched relevant certifications, updated LinkedIn profile, and planned for hackathon participation.

🔹 Step 5 — Career Roadmap

Created a 500–800 word long-term career plan focusing on building skills, certifications, project portfolio, internship experience, and placement goals.
